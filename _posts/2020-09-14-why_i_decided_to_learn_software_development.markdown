My journey to Software development started almost 3 years ago. I had just graduated from college with a degree in and was able to get a small marketing role for a local real estate agent firm. So as i sat at work everyday, going through a multitude of physical marketing materials i realized how much I hated that form of marketing and how much i wanted to work on more digital products.

My fiance was working in product so i started going with her to a lot of tech events and started getting to know some software developers and they would share with me what they did and the different languages they knew or were trying to master. So for the next 2 years i would start trying to use some self paced free courses, trying to learn a language. Every place i looked told me I should learn a different language, so i started playing with some javascript, then all the materials said to try python, so i tried python. Another resource said i should learn front end first so i started html and css. Then i found a Java course that i started taking, which made me feel like coding was impossible. It was all very confusing and stressful so while i got aclimated to my current job i took a break from coding.

Three months ago, my peak for coding resurfaced again, with a pandemic underway i found myself with some more time so i figured it was finally the time to start working on my website. I found an intro to computer science free online course that i started taking, and everything i had learn finally was starting to make sense. During this time i decided to start talking to software developers in my company and learning what they did. How they got started, what the job was like. I watched a lot of youtube videos and listened to podcasts to try and figure out if i should do a bootcamp or just keep learning on my own. 

Finally after a lot of introspection i decided that a career in software development is what i wanted to do. I love the problem solving that has to be done, and as frustrating as a code not working is, there is no better feeling then when you finally fix said code and your program works as intended. So finally i decided that i should finally take the steps to make this a career.
